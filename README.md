# GMMN
Graph mapping Mamba network for automated macular edema diagnosis from fundus images

## ðŸŒŸ Introduction

This project explores the combination of **Mamba** and **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)** for image analysis tasks. The integration of these two architectures represents a mutually beneficial design: Mamba contributes its strong capability for capturing **long-range dependencies**, which GCNs typically lack, while GCNs complement Mamba by enhancing **local connectivity modeling**, which Mamba may underexploit in visual tasks.

Moreover, both Mamba and GCN are inherently designed to process **1D sequential data**, which enables image representation and reasoning without the need for excessive 2D unfolding or complex restructuring. This synergy not only simplifies the data pipeline but also improves model efficiency and interpretability for image understanding tasks.
